                <p>Although My Ecommerce is not liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be held liable for losses caused to My Ecommerce or a third party due to such

                <p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information on how we use your data.</p>
                <h4 id="01-04">Acceptance of your order</h4>
                <p>All orders are subject to acceptance and availability; products in your shopping bag are not held or reserved and may be purchased by other customers.</p>
                <p>Once your order has been submitted to us by clicking “Order confirmation”, you will receive an e-mail acknowledging the details of your order (an “Order Acknowledgement E-mail”).
                However, this e-mail is NOT an acceptance of your order, it is only a confirmation that we have received and acknowledged your order.</p>
                <p>Once we have received your order, your order will be reviewed based on the following criteria before it is accepted:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Availability of the products ordered;</li>
                    <li>Whether or not your payment is authorized;</li>
                    <li>Whether your delivery address is within our shipping area;</li>
                    <li>You compliance with the Agreement; and</li>
                    <li>Any other requirements for order acceptance.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If there are any problems with any of the requirements above, we will not be able to accept your order and you will be notified via e-mail. If all of the requirements are met, we will send you an e-mail confirming the acceptance of your order (an “Order Acceptance E-mail”).</p>
                <p>Since we operate Monday through Friday and are closed on Saturdays, Sundays, and Armenian National holidays, orders submitted on Friday evening, Saturday, or Sunday (based on Armenia
                    Standard Time) will be processed on the following Monday (if Monday is a National Holiday then on the following business day).We appreciate your understanding for the delay of order
                acceptance on weekends, however some exceptions may apply.</p>
                <p>Following the acceptance of your order, the shipping process will start. We will carefully package the products and prepare documentation for shipping. After the package is prepared, it will be shipped to you via the shipping company. Subsequently you will receive an e-mail confirming (an “Order Completion E-mail”) that your order has been completed and the package has
                been shipped. We will normally charge the total amount of your order to your PayPal account at this time.</p>
                <h4 id="01-05">Incomplete or refused orders</h4>
                <p>If for some reason we are unable to fulfil your order following our Order Acknowledgement E-mail, we will contact you by e-mail informing you of the status of the order. My Ecommerce reserves the right to refuse an order and/or service to anyone at any time.</p>
                <h4 id="01-06">Cancelling your order</h4>
                <p>If you wish to cancel or modify your order please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:margaryan.mher.28@gmail.com">margaryan.mher.28@gmail.com</a> as soon as possible. We will make every effort to accommodate your request as your satisfaction is our top priority.</p>
                <p>In most cases, we will be able to accommodate your order cancellation or modification request prior to the dispatch of your package to the shipping company, under normal circumstances
                    this will be before you receive an Order Completion Email. However, we are unable to cancel or modify an order after the package has been dispatched to the shipping company for
                    shipping.<br />
                After your package has been dispatched, the process of cancelling your order will be classed as a Return. Please refer to the Returns process section for details. Please be advised that fees will be incurred in cancelling an order once it is classed as a Return.</p>
                <h3 id="02">Shipping</h3>
                <p>My Ecommerce prides itself on offering the highest quality products and fulfilling your orders accurately. All of our products are inspected prior to shipment so as to guarantee that they meet our quality standards.<br />
                    All orders are shipped from My Ecommerce in Yerevan, Armenia. We operate Monday through Friday and are closed on Saturdays, Sundays, and Armenian National holidays. Orders submitted on
                    Friday evening, Saturday, or Sunday (based on Armenia Standard Time) will be processed on the following Monday (if Monday is a National Holiday then on the following business day),
                however some exceptions may apply.</p>
                <h4 id="02-01">Shipping service provider</h4>
                <p>Based on the service quality and the reliability of the shipping company with respect to a particular order, we may use Yamato Transport Co., Ltd., DHL （DHL International GmbH.）, or
                    UPS （United Parcel Service, Inc.） for international shipments (local transportation may be handled by different local companies from time to time). All International shipments from Armenia
                are by air.</p>
                <h4 id="02-02">Packaging</h4>
                <p>We take extra care in packaging your order. If it is an international order, we ship your order in a durable shipping package box that meets generally accepted standards for international
                shipments.</p>
                <p>Each of our products comes in its own individual box. Then, all the products are carefully packaged in a durable shipping box with sufficient internal cushioning to protect the products during shipment.</p>
                <h4 id="02-03">Locations to which we ship</h4>
                <p>We ship our products within Armenia.<br />
                    Currently the locations to which we ship our products internationally regularly are limited to:<br />
                    Hong Kong (main area and unrestricted area only );<br />
                    <!--Macau (some undeliverable areas, please ask for further information);<br />
                    Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and Putrajaya, for other areas please ask for further information);-->
                    Singapore (some undeliverable areas, please ask for further information); and<br />
                Taiwan (main island only).</p>
                <p>Please note that we do not ship to PO Boxes or APO boxes.</p>
                <p>When you place an order with us we will confirm whether we can ship to the address you have designated or not, if not, we will notify you.</p>
                <p>If you live in the country that is not listed above and yet still wish to purchase our products, please contact <a href="mailto:margaryan.mher.28@gmail.com">margaryan.mher.28@gmail.com</a>. We would be happy to work with you to find a secure and feasible solution.</p>
                <p>Please be advised that delivery times are to be used as a general guide only. My Ecommerce cannot be held responsible for any delays caused by any local customs clearance processes or by
                circumstance beyond our control.</p>
                <h4 id="02-05">Shipping and handling fees, and insurance</h4>
                <p>For shipping within Armenia, we collect consumption tax and charge shipping and handling fees. Domestic shipping and handling fees may be adjusted according to the size and the destination of your shipment.</p>
                <p>For international shipping, we charge fees for international shipping and handling, these charges are exclusive of any customs duties and taxes levied by the country you are shipping to.
                International shipping and handling fees for limited destinations of Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, are normally fixed to 3,900 Dram per order, regardless of the order size of your shipment.</p>
                <p>For international shipping, shipping insurance of a maximum of 200,000 JPY per package during shipment is included in the shipping and handling fees. We will endeavor to split orders
                with multiple products with a combined value exceeding 200,000 JPY into separate packages with separate invoices so that the full value of the products is insured. Once a shipment reaches its destination it will no longer be insured by the shipping insurance.</p>
                <p>For domestic shipping, the terms are identical to the terms for international shipping except that the maximum insured value is 300,000 JPY.</p>
                <h4 id="02-06">Your obligation to pay customs duties, taxes and/or fees</h4>
                <p>If you are resident outside Armenia, we do not charge you any customs duties and taxes. However, as the recipient, you are liable for all customs duties, taxes, and/or fees that may be levied
                upon the shipment and such charges may need to be paid to the appropriate authority prior to taking delivery of the shipment.</p>
                <p>Please be assured that duties, taxes, and fees relating to importation are entirely exclusive of the amount that is charged to you by My Ecommerce; and please be
                particularly aware of this if you intend to purchase a product as a gift to be delivered directly to the recipient.</p>
                <p>If you are resident in Armenia, we will collect consumption tax on any products you purchase at the prevailing rate.</p>
                <h4 id="02-07">Possibilities for additional fees and delays due to customs clearance</h4>
                <p>Depending on the customs clearance procedures required by the customs authorities in the destination country, packages may be opened and physically examined by customs officers. We
                    do our very best to clearly document the contents of our shipment as required by customs authorities, however whether a package will be examined or not is beyond our control. If an
                    examination occurs, there may be a delay in the arrival of the package and/or extra charges levied upon you by the customs authority. Any such charges levied in relation to customs
                clearance must be borne by you. We appreciate your understanding with respect to such situations.</p>
                <h4 id="02-08">Your responsibility to receive the package</h4>
                <p>We require a signature for all products delivered, at which point responsibility for and possession of the products passes to the signee. If you have specified a recipient who is not you for delivery purposes (for example in the case of the product being a gift) then you accept that the provision of a signature at your designated delivery address is evidence of delivery and
                fulfilment of the order by My Ecommerce and you acknowledge and agree to the transfer of responsibility to the signee.</p>
                <p>Therefore, upon delivery of your package, we ask that you inspect the contents of the box carefully BEFORE signing for the delivery. If for any reason the box looks like it has been tampered with or seriously damaged, either sign for the package with reservations or refuse the package. Or if the package has been opened, and you find that there is something wrong with the
                    condition of its contents due to the shipping process, please immediately open a claim with the shipping company who delivered the package to you (their local contact address should be
                    on the delivery slip), and send an e-mail to us making sure to attach evidence of the problem. However, if any of the conditions complained of are due to customs inspection, then such
                cannot be the subject of a successful claim.</p>
                <p>If the package is not successfully delivered to you due to any misinformation on your part (for example, incorrect telephone number, incorrect address, or non-compliance with import
                    regulations) as per this Agreement, you risk the package being returned to My Ecommerce in Yerevan at your expense including any import fees, duties and taxes that may be levied upon reentry
                into Armenia.</p>
                <p>If you decide to refuse any shipments from My Ecommerce for any reasons not clearly attributable to My Ecommerce, you will be held responsible for the original shipping charges, duties, taxes and/or customs charges that are or have been incurred by the package (on both the original and return shipments), and the fees for returning the package to My Ecommerce. These costs will
                be deducted from any eventual refund.</p>
                <h3 id="03">Order tracking</h3>
                <p>All orders can be tracked during shipment and we will notify you of the tracking number and other necessary information as soon as it is available to us.<br />
                    When shipping within Armenia, a tracking number is available as soon as the package is shipped from My Ecommerce.<br />
                    For international shipping, international tracking numbers are only available from the time that your package clears Armenian export customs. We will notify you of the international
                    tracking number via e-mail after your package has cleared Armenian export customs as soon as we obtain it. Therefore please allow some time after the dispatch of your package prior to
                receive your international tracking number.</p>
                <h3 id="04">Returns and refunds policy</h3>
                <p>Customer satisfaction is our top priority, and as such we handle each query on an individual basis to the best of our ability. We would like to work with you to resolve any problem to the extent we can.</p>

                <h4 id="04-01">Returns</h4>
                <p>When you wish to return the products you have ordered, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:margaryan.mher.28@gmail.com">margaryan.mher.28@gmail.com</a> within 48 HOURS of the delivery of the products.<br />

                Phone number;<br />
                The products you wish to return; and<br />
            The reason.</p>
            <p>When we receive your return request we will provide you with a Return Authorization (RA) number that must be included with your return shipment.<br />
                Please return the products with all documentation, your RA number, original labels on their original boxes, the original packaged materials in their original shipping box, and in their
                original condition. (In the case of a partial product return, in the interests of economy a smaller shipping box of a similar quality to the one shipped to you may be used along with a
                reasonable amount of shock absorbing material.)<br />
                We ask that you dispatch the package to a local shipping company, with attention to the address shown below, within 7 days from the time of delivery of the products to you. Please note
                that we require that the products to be returned be received by us within 14 days from the time of delivery to you. See <a href="/terms#04-03">Required time frame for returns</a> for details.<br />
                Once we have received the products from you, we will confirm whether the returned products meet the required return conditions. We will refund the full product value (less shipping and
                handling fees), if the returned products meet all of the return conditions. Please note that all costs associated with the shipping of the returned products and all duties and taxes incurred
                due to the return are to be borne by you.<br />
                In the case of international returns, please be aware that in some cases products returned to My Ecommerce in Yerevan may incur import duties and taxes levied by the Armenian customs
                where the returned products are not adequately described as returned products. To minimize the risk of such occurrences, we require the return of all documentation that was issued to
                you when the products were originally shipped.<br />
                (Please be sure to keep the documents relating to customs duties and taxes that you may have paid to the local authorities as you may be able to recover any duties and/or taxes paid.)
                However we do not guarantee that unnecessary charges will not be incurred even if all documentation is in order. It often depends on how the returning shipping company handles the
                customs clearance process in Armenia. To such ends, we advise that you use the same shipping company who delivered the products to you in order to minimize the risk of incurring
                unnecessary charges.<br />
                We will do our best to minimize any unnecessary charges in relation to returns and will endeavor to clearly communicate with you as often as we can.

            returning shipping company that you have sufficient insurance coverage for your package.</p>
            <p>Every troubled case is unique and different. When you are having trouble with our products, it means that we are too. We do our best to communicate with you to try to understand the facts of the situations, and try to find the best solution.</p>
            <p>In cases where the situation is not contemplated by this Agreement, we will do our best to find a mutually acceptable solution. However, where the situation is contemplated by this
            Agreement, we will not deviate from it.</p>
            <h4 id="04-03">Required time frame for returns</h4>

            <h3 id="05">Product pricing and fees</h3>
            <p>The list price of each product is set and fixed in Armenian Dram (AMD) exclusive of Armenian consumption tax and any shipping and handling fees or any other fees.
            The list price represents purely the price of the product in Armenia, prices that are very competitive compared to other Armenian domestic vendors for the same quality product.</p>
            <p>Shipping and handling fees are charged separately after you enter into payment phase, and it is the only fee that we charge besides the list price. (Consumption tax is charged when
            purchased within Armenia.)</p>
            <p>For international purchases all items are Armenian DUTY  FREE, however please be on notice that you are liable for all customs duties and taxes levied by the destination country. Payment of such duties and taxes may be necessary
            upon delivery. Charges to your PayPal account made by My Ecommerce are totally exclusive of such duties and taxes. In no circumstance will we charge customs duties or taxes to your PayPal.</p>
            <h4 id="05-01">Pricing in your local currency guide only</h4>
            <p>For international purchases, prices are displayed in the currency based on the currency chosen by you. These local currency prices are calculated based on the actual price in JPY using a
                foreign currency exchange rate service (updated daily), such prices may fluctuate due to exchange rate fluctuations. Please note that prices displayed in your local currency are to be used as a guide only,
                the final price of the product charged to you in your local currency is solely dependent on your credit/debit card provider along with PayPal’s foreign exchange rates and polices. Please be aware
            that we have no control over the exact price charged to you in your local currency.</p>
            <h4 id="05-02">Estimates of Duties and taxes</h4>
            <p>Import duties and taxes that will be levied by the destination country, will differ from country to country. And those duties and taxes rates are based on the product specification that are defined by the international product code named “HS commodity code”. The products that we carry are all classified as “Tableware or kitchenware of wood” with HS commodity code of 4419.00.X category (X stands for unknown). The exact HS commodity code will differ from country to country. Exact HS commodity codes are as follows; Hong Kong:  4419.00.00, Singapore: 4419.00.00, Taiwan: 4419.00.00908</p>
            <p>Products under these categories, duties and taxes are as following rates;
                <dl>
                    <dt> Hong Kong</dt> <dd>0% duty rate with no sales tax and no other taxes. </dd>
                    <dt>Singapore</dt><dd>0% duty rate with 7% sales tax and no other taxes. </dd>
                    <dt>Taiwan</dt><dd>5% duty rate (above 3000 TWD (including shipping and insurance fee)) with 5% sales tax with trade promotion fee of 0.04%.</dd>
                </dl>
                <P>Based on those rates, duties and taxes could be estimated. Base price used to calculate the duties and taxes should be the total price charged by My Ecommerce (which includes international shipping and handling fees).  However, please be on notice that other charges may occur based on any requirements from the local authority, and we do not guarantee that any actual duties and fees charged will match the estimation.</p>
                <h3 id="06">Payments</h3>
                <p>We accept payments via PayPal. (PayPal account can be established with your VISA, Master, American Express, JCB credit/debit cards.) We do not accept personal checks, money orders or direct bank transfers. All purchases must be paid for in advance of shipping, however you will not be charged until your order is actually shipped.
